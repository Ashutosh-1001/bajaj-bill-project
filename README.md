This project reads medical bills and extracts all the important details using OCR and AI. You simply send a link to a bill image, and the API returns clean information such as item names, rates, quantities, and amounts in a neat JSON format. I built this for the HackRx Bajaj Datathon, focusing on accuracy and avoiding duplicate or missed items. The code is easy to run, works with common image formats, and is designed to make bill understanding simple and automatic.
